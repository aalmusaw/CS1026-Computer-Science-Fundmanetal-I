# CS1026-Computer-Science-Fundmanetal-I
This repository contains my course work for an introductory Computer Science course offered by the University of Western Ontario. I took this course in May 2019.

All uploaded submissions are as is and not corrected if there are any problems. 
This was my first programming course in Python. I have come a long way since then.
